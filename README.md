# Trust - A Garry's Mod Gamemode

Inspired by the classics like Trouble in Terrorist Town and Murder, I've decided to try out my own take on the deception game genre that takes place within my own fictional universe.

The premise is fairly simple; about 60% of players are victims of the criminal megarich's twisted camerashow, and the other 40% enjoy special -and often secretive- roles. Games are split into a series of 3 minute rounds, sandwiched between brief pre- and post-round phases in which players must deduce their peers' true intentions and ultimately survive.
